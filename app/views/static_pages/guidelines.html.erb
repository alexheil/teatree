          I wish there didn't have to be rules, but there has to be rules. Here's a list of them.

          What happens if I can't follow the guidelines?
        </div>

        <div class="padding-vertical">
          Unfortunately, if you can't play nice and follow these guidelines, you'll end up with an account ban.

        <div class="padding-vertical mid-text">
          What happens if I get banned?
        </div>

        <div class="padding-vertical">
          If you get banned, you will not be able upload videos, create comments, or subscribe to anyone. You'll still keep your current subscribers, but new people will not be able to subscribe to you. At the momemnt, there is no way to appeal a ban, so be careful.

          Anyway, here we go!

          You must only upload content that you have created or have the copyright for.
        </div>

        <div class="padding-vertical">
          This means do NOT upload a video that isn't yours or you don't have the copyright for. This means DO uplaod a video that you have created and have the copyright for. It's obvious. Tea Tree is a place for quality content. Not stolen stuff. (That's what the black market is for.)
